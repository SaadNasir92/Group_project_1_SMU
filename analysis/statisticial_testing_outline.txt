Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) Analysis

Descriptive Analysis:

Box Plot Explanation:
A box plot is used to visualize the distribution of DTI values for charged-off and fully paid loans. In this plot, the box represents the interquartile range (IQR), which contains the middle 50% of the data. The line inside the box is the median value, and the "whiskers" extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the IQR. Outliers are shown as individual points beyond the whiskers.
Interpretation: The box plot shows that the median DTI for charged-off loans is higher than for fully paid loans. The IQR for charged-off loans is also larger, indicating greater variability in DTI among charged-off loans.

Inferential Analysis:

Mann-Whitney U Test:

Purpose: The Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric test used to compare differences between two independent groups when the data is not normally distributed.
Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in DTI distributions between charged-off and fully paid loans.
Result: The test yielded a near-zero p-value, indicating that the observed difference in DTI distributions between the two groups is statistically significant and unlikely to have occurred by chance. Thus, we reject the null hypothesis.
Conclusion: The higher median DTI for charged-off loans suggests that higher DTI ratios are significantly associated with loan defaults.

Effect Size - Cliff's Delta:

Purpose: Cliff's Delta is a measure of effect size that indicates the degree of overlap between two distributions. It ranges from -1 to 1, where values close to -1 or 1 indicate less overlap.
Result: The consistently negative values (around -0.18) suggest a moderate effect size, indicating that higher DTI values are more likely to be observed in the charged-off group compared to the fully paid group.
Conclusion: The moderate effect size reinforces the finding that higher DTI ratios are more prevalent among charged-off loans, highlighting DTI as a critical factor in loan defaults.

Annual Income Analysis

Descriptive Analysis:

Count Plot Explanation:
A count plot displays the frequency of charged-off loans across various income levels. Each bar represents the number of charged-off loans within a specific income bracket.
Interpretation: The count plot indicates that as annual income increases, the number of charged-off loans decreases. This suggests a negative correlation between income levels and loan default rates.

Inferential Analysis:

Linear Regression:
Purpose: Linear regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (loan default status) and one or more independent variables (annual income).
Model: The model used is loan default status as a function of annual income.
Result: The regression model shows a relationship between income level and the number of charged-off loans. However, the p-value suggests this relationship might be due to chance, necessitating further testing for confirmation.
Conclusion: While the initial regression results indicate a potential relationship between higher income levels and lower default rates, the need for further testing highlights the importance of additional validation to confirm this finding.

Combined DTI & Annual Income Analysis

Descriptive Analysis:

Box Plot Explanation:
The box plot illustrates the distribution of DTI across different income levels for fully paid and charged-off loans.
Interpretation: The plot shows that the IQR of DTI is consistently higher across almost all income brackets for charged-off loans compared to fully paid loans. This suggests higher DTI ratios for charged-off loans regardless of income level.

Inferential Analysis:

Logistic Regression:

Purpose: Logistic regression is used to model the probability of a binary outcome (loan status) based on one or more predictor variables (DTI and income brackets).
Model: The model used is loan status as a function of DTI and income brackets.
Result: Both DTI and income brackets were significant predictors of loan status. Higher income brackets were associated with a lower likelihood of charge-offs, while higher DTI values increased the likelihood.
Conclusion: The logistic regression analysis confirms that both DTI and income levels are crucial in predicting loan defaults. Higher DTI increases the risk of default, while higher income levels reduce this risk.

Effect Size - Odds Ratios:

Purpose: Odds ratios measure the strength of association between predictors and the outcome. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates an increased likelihood of the outcome, while an odds ratio less than 1 indicates a decreased likelihood.
Result: The logistic regression coefficients and odds ratios indicate that a one-unit increase in DTI is associated with a ~3.8% increase in the odds of a loan being charged off. Each movement up an income bracket corresponds to a ~16.88% decrease in the odds of loans being charged off.
Conclusion: The odds ratios provide a quantifiable measure of the impact of DTI and income levels on loan default risk. This reinforces the importance of these variables in assessing borrower risk.

Summary of Statistical Findings

Key Insights:

Significant differences in DTI and income levels between charged-off and fully paid loans.
Higher DTI increases default risk; higher income decreases default risk.

Practical Implications:

Importance of considering both DTI and income in lending decisions.
Basis for recommendations on stricter lending criteria and targeted marketing.
